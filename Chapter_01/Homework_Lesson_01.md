# Adapting Joystics for Fly by Wire in Personal Flight Applications
## Executive Summary
While radio control systems for RC aircraft and drones are common, there are not yet good adaptations of high precission wired control systems (such as those commonly used in earth mover equipment and cranes) to manned drones and personal flight systems.  Existing control systems for these craft are invariably custom desings and are difficult or impossible to apply to new desings.  To address this gap, I intend to create a system for rapidly and accurately converting the analog signals from control systems ([such as those found here](https://ruffycontrols.com/)) to the 16 channel SBUS or Inverted SBUS protocal commonly used on existing flight computers.  Some of the important components include an ADC that can handle up to eight channels at 12 bit resolution or higher.  At least three major sets of hardware are required: something to adjust the voltage levels of the analog signals, somthing to log system health & errors, and an indicator LED and/or piezo buzzer for queing humans to review the data log when errors are detected.  Additionally, the ability to invert the signal if needed is desireable, either through software or with external hardware selected via jumper.  An overview diagram of the components can be seen below.
